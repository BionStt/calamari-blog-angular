            <p>Using ngrx/store (and some love for ngrx/effects) is definitely a great step for my productivity when managing state in Angular, and I want to share a small setup that'll allow you to preload data as normal with a Route Guard. The interesting thing is that the route guard will also make an API request if we currently have no data in the Store - and populate the store with the data before we finish transitioning to the route.</p>
            <p>This is great, because I can hit a particular route, it loads the data and populates my store, at which point I can navigate away from the route and come back. When I come back - as long as I haven't refreshed the app the data will still be in the Store, and skip the API request. This is neat!</p>

            <p>Let's take a snippet from the code I'm currently working on, where I have a higher level <code class="highlighter-rouge">CourseComponent</code> which embeds a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;router-outlet&gt;</code> for child routes.</p>
            <p>On the route, I've got a <code class="highlighter-rouge">canActivate</code> property which passes in my <code class="highlighter-rouge">CoursesGuard</code>. The role of this guard is to actually check our Store for data, and dispatch an action to make an API request if there's no data.</p>

        <p>First, let's assume the basics of a typical Route Guard:</p>
